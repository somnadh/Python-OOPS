# Python-OOPS
#OOPS in java Object An Object can be defined as an instance of a class. An object contains an address and takes up some space in memory. Objects can communicate without knowing the details of each other's data or code. Eg:A Student is an object because it has states like name, Rollno, Age etc.... as well as behaviors like Study ,Play, eating, etc...

Class: Collection of objects is called class.class is nothing but an BluePrint of an object Example:U have drawn picture of ur dream house using that we can assume that measurments but we could't live in that means there is no space is created for that but when we are going to construct that blueprint we can live. so class does't exist memory.when we create an instantiantion by new keyword then space will be allocated according to fields.

Inheritance: When one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object, it is known as inheritance. It provides code reusability. It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism. Example: child can acquire properties of their parents

Polymorphism If one task is performed in different ways, it is known as polymorphism. Example:One person can behave in different ways based on situations.

Abstraction: Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction. For example phone call, we don't know the internal processing.In Java, we use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction.

Encapsulation A java class is the example of encapsulation. Java bean is the fully encapsulated class because all the data members are private and Methods are public here.
